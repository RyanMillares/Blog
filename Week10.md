## Possible uses for Haskell and personal thoughts

* One of the most efficient ways to use Haskell is in creating a calculator. Its reliance on pattern-matching fits well with the arithmetic operations of a calculator and does not require many other functions outside of math.

* Haskell is very good with experimenting with different types of numbers such as Natural Numbers or Positive Numbers, and makes the process of recursion much simpler to understand without all the parenthesis and brackets in the way.

* Haskell is very useful for building code to function as an interpreter for a new, basic programming language that relies strictly on arithmetic and programs. The bnfc compiler can compile grammar front-end, so much of the work left would be to extend the grammar with new operations or functions, and the grammar itself is very easy to learn.

* One disadvantage of Haskell is its limitations in application. Since it does not function imperatively, there are a lot of algorithms that just would not be possible in a functional programming languages, such as use of coroutines to carry out multiple calculations at once, or a game relying on extensive switch statements, something for which Haskell would be extremely inefficient for.
